This course is an introduction to stochastic calculus and its applications to modern finance.
The core topics developed in the course are the Ito stochastic integral, Ito’s formula, and basic stochastic differential equations. The course will provide students with indispensable tools for valuation of financial derivatives and for keeping up with developments
in financial modeling.

Learning goals
1) Compute expectations of functions of Gaussian processes
2) Know the basic properties of martingales.
3) Develop an intuition for the properties of Brownian motion.
4) Compute expectation and probabilities of events of Brownian motion.
5) Develop an intuition for the Itô integral and its construction.
6) Compute expectations of functions of Itô processes using Itô formula.
7) Solve stochastic differential equations.
8) Apply stochastic calculus to financial situations.
